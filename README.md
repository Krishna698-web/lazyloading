The project has 3 files and an images folder that contains 10 dummy images and a gif image for loading animation.

Files,

1. index.html (html document)
2. script.js (contains javascript code / logic)
3. style.css (style sheet for the document).

In the project directory, you can run the index.html file with live server (should be priorly installed on vs code), and make sure all the neccessary files are attached before hosting.

- The project explains how the lazy loading works in order to avoid pagination.
- First 10 images will be preloaded as they are included statically, and next as the user scrolls he find an animation before the images are loaded.
